/* Mainly for testing */
/* Retained comments */
Including trailing // C++ style comments
What is the correct behaviour?  // The newline is part of the comment.
// The newline should be printed.
And with comment stripping?  // The newline should probably still be printed?
So that this text appears on a separate line from the question.
And what about newlines and /* C style */ comments when they are retained?
Perhaps a newline should be generated when the line had a comment on it somewhere?
Which function /* or functions */ controls this?

/*EOF*/
